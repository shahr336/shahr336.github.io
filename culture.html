                This spectacular festival honors the birth of the beloved Hindu elephant-headed god, Lord Ganesha, popularly worshiped for his ability to remove obstacles and bring good fortune. On the eleventh day of this festival the statue of Lord Ganesha is immersed into  a water body. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through a street procession. "Ganapati Bappa Morya" and "Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.

                The Holi festival commemorates the victory of good over evil, brought about by the burning and destruction of the demoness named Holika. This was enabled through unwavering devotion to the Hindu god of preservation, Lord Vishnu.

Holi got its name as the "Festival of Colors" from Lord Krishna, a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, who liked to play pranks on the village girls by drenching them in water and colors.

The festival marks the end of winter and the abundance of the upcoming spring harvest season.

            <div class="rambagh">
            Deepawali or Diwali (meaning "a row of lights") is certainly the biggest and the brightest of all Hindu festivals. It's the festival of lights that's marked by four days of celebration, which illuminates the country with its brilliance, and dazzles all with its joy. Each of the four days in the festival of Diwali is separated by a different tradition, but what remains true and constant is the celebration of life, its enjoyment and goodness.
